## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

I learned not to just jump into the project without taking the time to breakdown how things should function. Breaking the project down into smaller chunks was helpful.



### Continued development

This is my first javascript project. I enjoyed breaking down the each step in order to get the component to cuntion properly. I hope to continue developing my basic javascript knowledge by building more projects.
